# Project Description:
(Abstract)


# How to see the result and better leverage our model
To see a thorough workthrough of our project, please go to Report.ipynb where we provide detailed explaination of our idea, model and implementation. 

The trained model is located in model folder, you can build a model and load the weight, so that you can immediately generate music yourself.
All the function we defined are located in utils folder, and organized into 3 scripts, prep.py for all functions we need in data preparation, model.py for the model and custom loss function we use and visualizeMIDI.py for music visualization.

# Organization of this directory
