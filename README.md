# Project Description:
(Abstract)


# How to see the result and better leverage our model
To see a thorough workthrough of our project, please go to Report.ipynb where we provide detailed explaination of our idea, model and implementation. 

Due to limitation of storage space of github, unfortunately, the model file can't be pushed into github, however you may find the saved model file in following link. You can build a model and load the weight, so that you can immediately generate music yourself.

All the function we defined are located in utils folder, and organized into 3 scripts, prep.py for all functions we need in data preparation, model.py for the model and custom loss function we use and visualizeMIDI.py for music visualization.

Link to saved model:

Note: Download it and save it back to the folder specified above, then you can easily proceed to the next step. 
We are opening view access to everyone with lionmail, if you have trouble downloading that, please feel free to contact us.
